# Amanda Hanway - Web Mining & Applied Natural Language Processing, Module 7
- Final Project: Article Summarizer
- Date: 12/4/22

## Overview:  
This program was created as a final assignment for a master's course at NWMSU, Web Mining & Applied NLP.  

### Project Description   
- This program uses [Beautiful Soup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/) to scrape text from a website, and performs sentiment analysis using [spaCy](https://spacy.io/).  

### Original Data Source  
- Bogost, Ian. "The Madness of Twitter: People just canâ€™t stop tweeting about all the tweets they see." The Atlantic, 22 Nov. 2022, www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2022/11/elon-musk-twitter-bad-habit/672249/.

### Program Overview     
- Article-summarizer.ipynb
    - This program first scrapes the text of an article from a webpage, and writes the text to an html output file.
    - It then loads the text into a trained spaCy pipeline to generate a polarity score, and finds the most frequent words and lemmas.
    - Next, it generates a score for each sentence based on the count of important words and lemmas in the sentence, and plots the scores in a histogram.
    - Then, the program creates an article summary comprised of the highest-scored (most important) sentences.
    - Lastly, it finds the polarity score for the article summary.
